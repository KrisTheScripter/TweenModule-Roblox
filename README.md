# Hello,
I'm **Kris**. This module allows you to **easily tween your objects** or **tween your objects in unique way** that TweenService doesn't provide.

P. s. Sorry for bad English if it is.

+ Current version is **1.6.4**
+ Created by **Kris (xXxKrisstalDragonxXx)**
+ Special thanks to **Cordie** for helping me to create curve tweens (**CurveService**)!

# Features:
+ Supports **models** (works with pivot)
+ Supports **localscripts**
+ **Easy** to use
+ Has **Quadratic bezier** tweens (curveservice)
+ Has **string and number** interpolating function
+ Has **custom tweens** (from 1.5.1) that work like normal tweens

# API is provided here (API.md)! It's very easy!
